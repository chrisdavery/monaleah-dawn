He followed my uncle home one day, and from that first look, I knew he was mine. He was this perfect mix of an old soul and a playful spirit; he was protective enough to watch over our whole family yet so deeply gentle in everything he did. When he passed, the silence he left behind was deafening. I woke up every day reaching for him and missing the weight of his presence.</p><p>Then came Tuni.</p><p>I found her in an old church; she was a tiny, fragile kitten only five days old. She was so small I was terrified to hold her, but she turned out to be the strongest soul I’ve ever met. She went from a fragile rescue to the boss of the entire house. She was my shadow, snuggling up every single night, and she would fall asleep on my hand while I stayed perfectly still so I wouldn’t wake her. Losing her in 2020 felt like losing a piece of my own heartbeat.</p>",
